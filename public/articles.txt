[["When Pei Ying Yu and Yan Nong Yu learn they have to leave their apartment immediately, it comes as a sudden shock even though they\u2019ve been dreading it for months. It\u2019s January 28, 2015, the day after a blizzard hit Boston. The schools are closed and the governor told commuters to stay home. Along the narrow streets of Chinatown, the owners of grocery shops and bakeries shovel sidewalks while pedestrians climb over snowbanks, everyone displaying the exaggerated courtesy of neighbors getting through a minor disaster together.","Pei Ying is in her sixties; she came to the U.S. in 2008. Her younger sister followed two years later. Both speak very little English and make under $12 an hour as home health aides. Their apartment, which they\u2019ve lived in since 2013 and share with another roommate, is part of a broken-down row house building at 103 Hudson St. When a new landlord bought the building in mid-January, the Yus knew he\u2019d have a lot of work to do to bring it up to code. That meant he would need to move them, and the rest of the tenants, into a hotel for a while.","View this image \u203a","The two sisters stand in front of their old apartment building.  Kieran Kesner for BuzzFeed News","The sisters are at their jobs when they get the news. Yan Nong hadn\u2019t been home since the day before \u2014 she was snowed in at a client\u2019s house. After work, they cram their clothes, clean or dirty, into plastic trash bags and talk about what might happen next. It isn\u2019t just the inconvenience of being temporarily relocated to a hotel that worries the Yus. They wonder if, once they leave their home, they\u2019ll ever be allowed to move back.","Boston\u2019s Chinatown, home to around 12,000 people, takes up a quarter of a square mile near the center of Boston \u2014 an area that\u2019s in the midst of a luxury housing boom. Seven blocks away, a new, towering apartment building, The Kensington, is asking more than $4,000 a month for an 822-square-foot one-bedroom, more than five times the $700 that the Yus and their roommate pay.","While the Yus and their neighbors pack up, community organizer Karen Chen talks with them about their next steps. She and a half-dozen volunteers document the possessions tenants will have to leave behind, make calls to the media, and hand out signs to supporters who joined them: \u201cStop Corporate Greed\u201d and \u201cThis Is Our Home\u201d and \u201cWe Shall Not Be Moved.\u201d","Chen is co-director of the Chinese Progressive Association, a group that\u2019s been at the forefront of a fight to keep Boston\u2019s Chinatown from disappearing. The CPA was founded in 1977 to work on issues, from housing to employment, that concerned Chinese-Americans in Greater Boston. Its small headquarters, just a few blocks from the Yus\u2019 home, is often crowded with older Chinese-speaking local residents volunteering or seeking help. It also draws younger Chinese-American volunteers from all over the area, many of them high school and college students who have never lived in Chinatown but have strong ties to the neighborhood through their families.","View this image \u203a","Source: BRA, Chinatown Master Plan 2010; apartmentguide.com ","As the protesters chant and sing in front of the building\u2019s steps, the person they\u2019re protesting walks over to stand on the sidelines. Tim O\u2019Callaghan, a former firefighter whose real estate company, First Suffolk LLC, had bought the old brick row house, is visibly flummoxed.","\u201cI just want for you to understand,\u201d he tells the protesters. \u201cI\u2019m a humanist. I\u2019m not a pig.\u201d","O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s a longtime Boston developer, middle-aged with stubble and blue jeans, a pair of reading glasses perched on his baseball cap. He\u2019s built his business for years while serving in the fire department, and since retiring in 2011 he\u2019s been at it full-time.","He says the protesters have him all wrong. He\u2019s a good guy. He works 12-hour days. In a different time and place, he says, he\u2019d be standing with the tenants against big, unscrupulous developers. \u201cPeople sell buildings in South Boston every day in Back Bay,\u201d he continues. \u201cWhat makes Chinatown any different?\u201d Consequently, \u201cI think this is harassment, what [the protesters] are doing.\u201d","For O\u2019Callaghan, the argument is straightforward: The previous owners left it an uninhabitable mess, so, by rehabilitating it, he\u2019s doing the tenants a favor. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame a building could sit here 75 years being in that condition,\u201d he explains. No one is debating that part: The city even filed criminal charges against the previous owners on account of the structural violations. What the protesters contest is whether the current tenants will ultimately benefit from those improvements. Chen says the plan is for the work to take six to nine months while O\u2019Callaghan (who addresses her as a \u201cbeautiful woman\u201d) puts the tenants up in a hotel.","View this image \u203a","Source: Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, 2013 ","It\u2019s a pattern becoming more and more familiar in the transitioning neighborhood. A 2013 report by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) found that the absolute number of Asian residents in Boston\u2019s Chinatown actually increased a little in recent decades, as tall apartment and condo buildings nearly doubled the neighborhood\u2019s population. Yet the overall percentage of Asian residents in Boston\u2019s Chinatown fell from 70% to 46% between 1990 and 2010. And the economic discrepancies between the two groups are extreme: The typical Asian household in the neighborhood made $13,057 in 2009, while the typical white one made $84,255. When a new residential project across from the Yu\u2019s building designated 95 affordable units, it received more than 4,000 applications.","And it isn\u2019t just Boston. Gentrification is not a new reality in American cities, but it is reshaping the country\u2019s Chinatowns at a rapid pace. In New York City\u2019s, strong community organizations and ownership of buildings by Chinese associations have helped stem the loss of housing for immigrants, but local advocacy groups say displacement is still a looming threat; a recent Vocativ analysis found that Chinese-Americans in NYC\u2019s Chinatown dropped from 55 to 49% between 2009 and 2014. The shift in Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown has been even more dramatic, dropping from 74 to 48% in that same period. In Washington, D.C.\u2019s Chinatown, there are only 300 Chinese-American residents left, down from a peak of 3,000 in 1970. The area\u2019s still a tourist destination with Chinese restaurants, and a city regulation means that all businesses in the area have Chinese signage \u2014 you can find a Hooters with a sign in English and Chinese characters. But the local Chinese grocery stores and bakeries have all shut down.","\u201cThat is our nightmare,\u201d says Andrew Leong, an associate professor of law, social justice, and Asian American studies at University of Massachusetts, Boston, who co-authored the AALDEF study. \u201cThat\u2019s our warning sign. That\u2019s what we do not want our Chinatowns, our living communities, to turn into.\u201d","As the rally continues, several members of the local press approach O\u2019Callaghan and he declines comment. But then, as Pei Ying Yu takes the mic to tell her story, he suddenly interrupts to call to the reporters: \u201cShe can move back in the building. You can put that on record.\u201d State law requires that tenants displaced for a building rehab be allowed to return, he says. (Which is sort of true: Were O\u2019Callaghan to evict the tenants that day, they could have protested due to the building\u2019s code violations. But no-fault evictions are legal in Massachusetts, so once the building is repaired, he\u2019ll be within his rights to evict the tenants and raise rents.)","But O\u2019Callaghan insists it isn\u2019t just a matter of following the law. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to displace the people,\u201d he promises, as the tenants pack their belongings inside. \u201cThey\u2019re going to move back in. They\u2019re coming back. They\u2019re not going to get screwed.\u201d","View this image \u203a"," Kieran Kesner for BuzzFeed News","The Yus\u2019 apartment is part of a few blocks of row houses, dotted with produce stands and tiny grocery stores and wedged between Tufts hospital, a DoubleTree Hotel, and the I-90\u2013I-93 interchange. Nearby, in the shadow of growing high-rise apartment buildings just a few blocks from Boston Common, is a cluster of hot pot and dumpling restaurants with bright red and yellow signs. There are a couple chain stores \u2014 a CVS, a Boston Pizza \u2014 but also social clubs where new immigrants get help translating paperwork and finding jobs. At the local public elementary school, students learn English and Mandarin and celebrate Chinese festivals.","Hemmed in by poverty and discrimination in the 1870s, Chinese immigrant workers settled in a neighborhood that was home to a series of impoverished immigrant groups: Syrians, Jews, Irish, and Italians. Riddled by railroad tracks and terminals, it was one of the worst places in the city to live. Chinese residents put up laundries and restaurants, building what would be a center of Asian-American life in New England for more than a century.","In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act barred most Chinese women and children from immigrating, leaving the neighborhood a little world made up almost entirely of men. So local leaders built a system of family associations: surrogate uncles and nephews and cousins bound together in mutual support by a common family name. That same exclusion helped give rise to organized crime; a 1974 city decision to locate a red-light district known as the Combat Zone right next door to Chinatown also stoked Bostonians\u2019 concerns that it was a dangerous place to live. But those worries dissipated as crime fell throughout the city over the past two decades. Since 2005, dozens of neighborhood volunteers in blue vests have been patrolling the streets in the evenings, helping to keep illegal activity down.","View this image \u203a","A man reads a community bulletin board in Chinatown where local announcements, job notices, news items, and cultural events were posted.  Boston Globe \/ Getty Images","Chuck Kwong, an upstairs neighbor of the Yus who\u2019s around their age but has lived in Chinatown much longer, recalls the neighborhood as he found it when he first moved to Boston in the early \u201970s. He\u2019d been able to rent an apartment with friends for $100 a month \u2014 worth it even though they spent very little time there. He\u2019d work at restaurants on Cape Cod, staying in boarding houses owned by his employer. On his days off, he returned to the apartment and spent hours wandering through Chinatown, stopping at restaurants and bakeries and social clubs where locals played mahjong.","But the neighborhood was already starting to get squeezed. Between the 1950s and 1970s, state and local governments built roads through Chinatown, knocking down homes and businesses. Urban renewal projects razed apartment buildings and replaced them with hospital and medical school buildings. Then, with the turn of the new millennium, luxury condos and apartments sprang up. Today, Kwong says, the social clubs are still filled with old-timers, but for the most part, new immigrants who could use their support can\u2019t find anywhere to live in Chinatown.","From one perspective, what\u2019s happening is just part of life in a dynamic, thriving city.","\u201cIt is natural and it needs to happen,\u201d says Skip Schloming, executive director of the Small Property Owners Association, a Boston-area landlords\u2019 group. \u201cThe neighborhood needs to adjust to what\u2019s needed.\u201d","Schloming says it\u2019s common for old buildings with low rents to deteriorate because the owners don\u2019t have money for proper repairs. A booming housing market means landlords have the incentive to make improvements, but only if they\u2019re able to charge higher rents. If that means displacing lower-income tenants, Schloming argues, the city should provide relocation services, helping tenants to find apartments in more affordable neighborhoods where they can reconstitute their local communities.","To some extent, that kind of relocation of the community is already happening, with many Chinese immigrants now living in the Boston suburbs of Malden and Quincy. But Leong, the UMass professor, says these Chinese enclaves are too diffuse to replicate Chinatown.","It\u2019s something the Yus themselves had experienced prior to moving to Boston. They grew up together in China\u2019s Guangdong province, but took different routes to America as middle-aged adults. Pei Ying\u2019s a tiny, gregarious woman who usually wears jeans, graying hair tied up in a practical bun. She was an accountant before she left Guangdong for Atlanta, where her grown son still lives. Yan Nong, the more shy of the two, headed to San Diego, a longtime destination for Chinese immigrants. Yet without cars, U.S. work experience, or strong English proficiency, both sisters struggled to adapt to life in cities without major Chinatowns.","Acquaintances insisted that things were different in Boston. When they arrived, they were thrilled to find streets densely packed with shops catering to Chinese tastes and a bus and subway system that let them travel independently to jobs. In the midst of the tight real estate market, it was their new network of friends in Chinatown that helped them find the apartment at 103 Hudson.","\u201cYou can take transportation everywhere,\u201d Pei Ying Yu says. \u201cLots of agencies in Chinatown can read over letters for you. It\u2019s very easy. There\u2019s a lot of places to learn English as well.\u201d","Beyond practical conveniences, she says, there\u2019s a sense of comfort in Boston\u2019s Chinatown that she and her sister hadn\u2019t found in other American cities. She said that, if it weren\u2019t for housing issues, she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend Boston to any Chinese immigrant.","\u201cI would say to them that coming to Boston will be just like going home, because everything you find at home you can find here in Boston,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a language barrier. You step out your door, you\u2019re going to have access to Chinese people.\u201d","View this image \u203a"," Kieran Kesner for BuzzFeed News","When the Yus leave their apartment that January day, they head to a no-frills hotel O\u2019Callaghan arranged for them, about a mile and a half away from the old building.","From the outside, the hotel looks like a welcome alternative for the Yus \u2014 they aren\u2019t homeless; they don\u2019t have to pay rent \u2014 but privately, the sisters struggle with life there. To their dismay, it has no cooking facilities. The stores they know and neighbors who speak their language are a dozen blocks away. It takes them a week to figure out which buses they need to take to get to their jobs.","A few weeks later, just as they\u2019re beginning to get into a routine, O\u2019Callaghan moves the tenants to another hotel, this time in the Boston suburb of Quincy. It\u2019s a gleaming Marriott high on a hill with a $16.95 breakfast buffet. For business travelers, this would be a nice upgrade, but the place is unsuitable for two older women with no car who speak very little English. Pei Ying\u2019s commute requires her to take the hotel shuttle to the subway to the bus; since the first shuttle leaves at 7 and her job starts at 8:30, that means getting to work late. The organizers say they call O\u2019Callaghan when more suitable places open up, like apartments with kitchens in Chinatown, but he doesn\u2019t get back to them in time. They think this hotel might be a way to get tenants to give up on moving back to Hudson Street. O\u2019Callaghan declined repeated requests for comment on why he selected the hotel and the CPA\u2019s comments regarding it.","Most of the tenants find more convenient places to stay, for the moment at least \u2014 some quietly double or triple up with friends at their apartments, hoping the landlord doesn\u2019t notice or doesn\u2019t care. But the Yus don\u2019t have anywhere else to go. They stay at the shiny hotel.","Over the next few months, no work moves forward at 103 Hudson. O\u2019Callaghan doesn\u2019t even apply for building permits. The CPA urges him to make a deal, asking for a multi-year contract with the tenants that includes at least one year without raising the rent. They organize rallies, bringing out white-haired longtime Chinatown residents, young Chinese-American activists from neighboring towns, and supporters from other Boston housing rights groups.","The sisters, along with the rest of the Hudson Street tenants, become symbols of the danger Chinatown is in. Local media showed up the day the Yus moved out in January, and outlets continue to cover their situation. In April, the Boston Globe runs a feature on housing in Chinatown centered on Pei Ying.","The Yus, who\u2019ve never been involved in any kind of activism before, take personal days from their jobs to show up at the rallies. They chant slogans and tell their stories, breaking down crying in front of TV cameras and crowds of strangers.","View this image \u203a"," Kieran Kesner for BuzzFeed News","In early April, Pei Ying marches with dozens of supporters from her old apartment on Hudson Street to City Hall. She tells her story again, recalling the time she hopped on the Marriott shuttle to get to her subway stop and discovered too late it was actually headed to a shopping mall. She ended up stranded, late for work, and terrified of losing her job. Lately, she\u2019s taken to keeping a loaf of bread in the big red backpack she carries everywhere, in case she gets lost and can\u2019t find anything else to eat.","\u201cThis heartless, heartless landlord, he has no idea what the tenants have to go through,\u201d she tells the crowd. \u201cI just want a home. I just want a place to stay. I did not do anything wrong. I was a good tenant. I was working, trying to pay my rent. All I ask is that I can come back to my home, come back to Chinatown.\u201d","She insists none of this has soured her feelings about Americans. She keeps talking about how nice people have been to her, how many friends she\u2019d make if she could just speak English better. She remembers one night when she was still adjusting to life at the first hotel. She got off the bus and couldn\u2019t find her way home. It was snowing hard, and the only people on the streets were an American couple. Somehow, she communicated where she needed to go.","\u201cThey both held one arm of mine and led me back to my hotel,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt was so cold. The snow came up to our knees.\u201d","Through a translator, I ask what she\u2019ll do if she can\u2019t go back to her apartment. She says she doesn\u2019t know. \u201cI don\u2019t have a next step,\u201d she says. \u201cI am in desperation right now.\u201d","After cheering Pei Ying Yu and other speakers at the rally, the crowd of CPA supporters files into City Hall along with hundreds more people from all over Boston. A city councilor has called a hearing on housing affordability, and the council chamber is packed.","For the first two and a half hours of the hearing, city officials and nonprofit leaders talk big picture. Boston\u2019s housing chief explains that the city has a plan to create 53,000 new units of housing. But only 1,700 of these are for people with very low incomes \u2014 up to $49,250 for a family of four. Leaders of local community development corporations talk about how they\u2019ve been able to get affordable units built over the years \u2014 but nowhere near enough to fill the need in their neighborhoods. The head of the Fair Housing Center of Greater Boston says the city is facing a new sort of gentrification, driven largely by large institutional investors and developers jumping on an obvious chance to buy high and sell higher.","Then, at 6:40 p.m., they open the floor for public comment.","Dozens of people line up for their turn at the mic. There\u2019s an Italian-American woman who grew up in working-class South Boston, where locals identified themselves by which Catholic parish they were in \u2014 her mom was from Gate of Heaven, her dad from Saint Brigid. Now, she says, she\u2019s been forced out by the cost of housing. All the new construction is luxury condos. \u201cWhen did luxury become the standard?\u201d she asks. \u201cLuxury used to be a choice.\u201d","View this image \u203a"," Livia Gershon for BuzzFeed News","Andres del Castillo, an earnest young community organizer from East Boston, talks about how his sisters volunteered in the neighborhood when he was growing up, helping to turn it from a high-crime area into a cultural center for Boston-area Latinos. But today, he and his two roommates can barely afford to pay their rent there, even though they\u2019re young working guys with no kids to support.","Someone asks del Castillo to wrap up. Sixty-four people have signed up for the public comment period. At this rate the hearing could go on all night.","Del Castillo doesn\u2019t surrender the mic immediately. \u201cIf our city isn\u2019t answering for its residents, I mean, what is it here for?\u201d he asks. \u201cProfit is not enough of a motive. Profit is not enough of a reason.\u201d","This, by most standards, is a terribly naive thing to say. Schloming, the head of the Boston landlords\u2019 group, says it\u2019s easy to complain about greedy building owners, but the profit motive is what gets new housing built and old housing properly maintained. Limiting the rent landlords can charge, or making evictions more difficult, means development grinds to a halt. The nightmare case, Schloming continues, is landlords burning down their buildings for the insurance money because it\u2019s impossible to make money on them.","If we really want to promote affordable housing, he explains, one solution is less regulation. Better zoning rules could promote a dense city full of pedestrians and bikes, allowing large apartments to be subdivided into smaller ones and removing requirements that buildings include spots to park cars.","\u201cThe city needs to be prepared to adjust to a new society,\u201d Schloming says. \u201cBoston needs to grow.\u201d","View this image \u203a"," Livia Gershon for BuzzFeed News","There\u2019s a counter-narrative, however, that groups like the Chinese Progressive Association are promoting. Coined by French philosopher Henri Lefebvre, \u201cright to the city\u201d is a school of civic thought that seeks to empower urban dwellers. In short, it means that a city is created by the people who live there, so they ought to run it. The phrase has been adopted by everyone from refugees in Germany to Turkish opponents of a shopping mall planned for a major city square to anti-foreclosure activists in New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, D.C.","The CPA is part of a national organization called the Right to the City Alliance, which turns that notion into specific policy goals for the U.S. In a 2014 report, the alliance noted that 28% of U.S. renter households in 2011 spent more than half their income on rent. The alliance calls for some drastic measures, including rent control laws, construction of more public housing, and restrictions on the ability of investors to buy and sell housing for a profit.","One model that the Right to the City Alliance favors is the community land trust. The idea is a sort of land ownership cooperative that lets buildings be bought and sold while making sure they stay affordable. One such community-run housing model exists right here in Boston: the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative community land trust. When the housing market crashed, the land trust helped its members escape foreclosures. When home prices bounced back higher than ever, Dudley Street avoided price hikes and displacement. In the months before Tim O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s company bought 103 Hudson St., the CPA had been trying to get the old owner to sell it to a newly formed Chinatown Community Land Trust, partly modeled after Dudley Street, but O\u2019Callaghan put down a better offer on the building.","A couple of weeks after the City Hall hearing, I reach out to him again.","He picks up his cell phone, but the connection is bad, and he doesn\u2019t want to talk. He asks me to leave him alone. He doesn\u2019t hang up, though. He says he\u2019s figuring out how to do right by the tenants and negotiating with them over the leases \u2014 if they can get approved for federal Section 8 housing vouchers, he\u2019ll be able to move them back in once the rehab is complete.","It\u2019s noble, but unfortunately unlikely. Only 1 in 4 Americans who qualify for vouchers get one. In Boston, the waitlist for Section 8 has 40,000 names on it, which translates to an 11-year wait.","O\u2019Callaghan starts to sound aggrieved. He notes that he\u2019s putting the tenants up in the hotel for months. \u201cThey\u2019re living the American Dream,\u201d he says, \u201cfor free.\u201d Then he catches himself. \u201cIt\u2019s a very overwhelming process.

Running on two hours of sleep, he\u2019s off to pick up Pei Ying and Yan Nong at the Quincy Marriott and bring them to Chinatown.","Louie\u2019s been driving the Yus once or twice a week. He\u2019s one of the volunteers the CPA has arranged to ferry the sisters to and from the hotel everyday. Dressed in a hoodie and a backward baseball cap, the 28-year-old grew up in working-class Boston suburbs, but Chinatown was always central to his family\u2019s life.","\u201cIt\u2019s the place we go every Sunday morning for dim sum,\u201d he tells me as we take off toward Quincy. \u201cIt was the place where my mom, who was a Chinese immigrant, could kind of be at home.\u201d","Louie\u2019s mother moved to America around age 20, where she became a history teacher at a bilingual Boston school and started a Chinese rock band out of a Chinatown studio. Louie joined the CPA\u2019s youth program at 17 and later became the program\u2019s director. In 2013, he left Boston for a year in China. When he came back, he found himself spending more time with friends in Chinatown than in the suburb where he lived.","As we hurtle down the tangled Boston highways toward Quincy, Louie tells me he wants to stop and get something to eat. Otherwise, he knows from experience, Pei Ying Yu will try to buy him breakfast when they get to Chinatown. If she bought breakfast for everyone who drove her, she\u2019d be completely broke, he says.","Bag of donuts in hand, we pull up in front of the Marriott around 6:30. The Yu sisters are at the revolving door. Pei Ying holds her heavy red backpack, which holds her lunch and bottled water. She\u2019s also taken to carrying her passport and important papers around with her; she doesn\u2019t feel safe leaving them anywhere. Her shoulder hurts.","As he drives, Louie translates for me as the Yus tell us about their recent transportation mishaps: ending up on subway lines going to the wrong destination or getting to their stop after 9 p.m., when the hotel shuttle stops running. They say they\u2019re so grateful to the volunteers who drive them to and from the hotel. They talk about feeling guilty when they don\u2019t have the money to tip hotel maids or shuttle bus drivers. They say not being able to cook means eating expensive, unhealthy meals \u2014 often cold sandwiches or pastries that they pick up when they manage to get to Chinatown \u2014 but they don\u2019t see another option.","\u201cThere\u2019s kind of this anxiousness that she has every day now being away from the home,\u201d Louie says, translating for Pei Ying. \u201cNot knowing moment to moment where you can be and what you can trust and what you can\u2019t trust.\u201d","Yan Nong mostly stays quiet. But then we get to talking about the landlord. Suddenly she speaks up, fast and adamant.","\u201cWhy in the U.S., and why in America, why is there this kind of discrimination and exploitation of Chinese working-class immigrants?\u201d Louie translates. \u201cAnd why can\u2019t the U.S. system do anything about this? Why do we have to live through this?\u201d","We arrive at Chinatown around 7. Yan Nong works around here, but Pei Ying still has to catch a bus to her job outside Boston. Louie navigates small streets clogged with delivery trucks bringing food to the restaurants and corner stores.","After she gets out of the car, Pei Ying heads straight to a bakery and buys a number of pastries and sandwiches. As I take photos, she points to various items, and, after a while, I understand she wants to buy me something. I shake my head and say no repeatedly, but she buys a sandwich for me anyway, a sort of club with lettuce, ham, and pressed tofu.","As she leaves the bakery, she runs into someone she knows from the neighborhood and they chat briefly in Chinese. But she\u2019s in a hurry, so she resumes walking the few blocks left to the bus stop. She says goodbye to me by pressing her hand to her heart.","View this image \u203a","Pei Ying Yu.

O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s company has finally filed for a permit, and it\u2019s not to spend a few months refurbishing the building and bringing it up to code. He wants to gut the whole thing, combine it with a neighboring building that the company also bought, and build additions, turning the combined property from eight apartments into 10.","This means two things: First, if the permit goes through, there\u2019s very little chance of a city takeover of the building. And second, it will be a long time before any tenant \u2014 old or new \u2014 lives at the building again.","Months pass with the Yus camped out in Quincy, still not paying rent but still in housing limbo. The CPA organizers look for ways to stop O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s plans as they wind their way through the city\u2019s permitting process, without success. Ultimately, there\u2019s just not much the city can do about the things a landowner wants to do with his own property.","The city comes to Pei Ying Yu\u2019s aid in a different way. Because she\u2019s over 60, she qualifies for senior housing, which has a much shorter waitlist than other subsidized housing in the city. At the end of August, she reaches the top of the list and gets a place in a building in Boston\u2019s South End, on the other side of I-90 from Chinatown. She isn\u2019t crazy about the location; during the day, it\u2019s a 20-minute bus ride to buy groceries in her old neighborhood, and at night \u2014 when buses don\u2019t run as frequently \u2014 she finds herself walking through unfamiliar streets. But at least she has a kitchen again.","View this image \u203a","Pei Ying Yu speaking at a protest.  Livia Gershon for BuzzFeed News","The next time I see Pei Ying, in November, she\u2019s visibly more relaxed than she\u2019s been before. We meet at the CPA headquarters, commandeering an office where we can speak privately. Speaking through a translator, she tells me she\u2019s able to cook for herself at her new place, which is a huge relief, even if she still has to take a bus into Chinatown to do her grocery shopping. Yu spends a lot of her time in Chinatown for other reasons, too. Through CPA, she\u2019s become active in the Fight for $15 living wage campaign. She was recently elected to the steering board of the neighborhood\u2019s highly active residents\u2019 association.","\u201cBeing on the steering committee gives you a voice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt allows me to vocalize my needs and then be able to advocate for them. Also you get a lot of information if you want to participate in the different activities in the community.\u201d","She says becoming an activist has changed her. \u201cIt\u2019s really great spiritual nurturing for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel much more alive.\u201d","In December, O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s company received its permit for reconstruction of the Hudson Street building, but very little work seems to have moved forward over the winter. The city\u2019s Inspectional Services Department found 101 Hudson uninhabitable, so on March 4, 2016, the four tenants living there were forced to move out. Chen says they\u2019re now staying with family or couch-surfing.","With the help of their legal aid lawyer, the Yus are pursuing two civil cases against O\u2019Callaghan and his company, arguing, among other things, that while they were still living in their apartment he barged into their unit, intimidated them, and discriminated against them by refusing to let them use Chinese Progressive Association staff as translators. O\u2019Callaghan, First Suffolk, and their lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding plans for the buildings, the future of tenants there, and the civil cases.","As of March 10, Yan Nong is still living at the hotel, but the CPA\u2019s Karen Chen says she spends many nights at friends\u2019 homes to ease her commute.","Meanwhile, the CPA, together with a coalition of other Boston tenants\u2019 groups, is pushing for broader change, including an end to no-fault evictions and a new long-term city development plan that prioritizes housing for people of all income levels. They\u2019ve had some success convincing Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to come out in favor of just-cause evictions, but there\u2019s still a long way to go.","After her whirlwind year, Pei Ying Yu wants to stick out that fight.","\u201cChinatown has 150 years of history,\u201d she says. \u201cAs Chinese people, we have the obligation to protect this history. We want Chinatown to glow.\u201d \u25cf","View this image \u203a"," Kieran Kesner for BuzzFeed","UPDATE","\n\t\t\tThis story has been updated to clarify the demographics of South Boston.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t  \n\t          BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById(\"update_article_update_time_8225636\").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date('1458071698', 'update'); });\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t","","Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!"]," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",[]," A Girl Obsessed With Sloths Gets Surprised With A\u00a0Sloth"," We Tried The Gwyneth Paltrow \u201c$200\u201d Smoothie So You Don\u2019t Have\u00a0To"," We Tried The Gwyneth Paltrow \u201c$200\u201d Smoothie So You Don\u2019t Have\u00a0To"," We Tried The Gwyneth Paltrow \u201c$200\u201d Smoothie So You Don\u2019t Have\u00a0To"," We Tried The Gwyneth Paltrow \u201c$200\u201d Smoothie So You Don\u2019t Have\u00a0To"," We Tried The Gwyneth Paltrow \u201c$200\u201d Smoothie So You Don\u2019t Have\u00a0To"," We Tried The Gwyneth Paltrow \u201c$200\u201d Smoothie So You Don\u2019t Have\u00a0To"," We Tried The Gwyneth Paltrow \u201c$200\u201d Smoothie So You Don\u2019t Have\u00a0To"," We Tried The Gwyneth Paltrow \u201c$200\u201d Smoothie So You Don\u2019t Have\u00a0To"," We Tried The Gwyneth Paltrow \u201c$200\u201d Smoothie So You Don\u2019t Have\u00a0To",["View this image \u203a","A bag of chips is delicious, but it probably won\u2019t actually tide you over until your next meal.

Damien Leonhardt","","\u201cYou dun goofed!\u201d was the line that turned Jessi Slaughter into a meme, the accidental start of a viral video seen over a million times in just a few weeks in 2010. Jessi was only 11 years old. In the video, Jessi wears a zebra-striped T-shirt and cries while Gene Leonhardt (Jessi\u2019s dad), down one one knee, screams into the camera, pointing his finger. \u201cI know who it\u2019s coming from, because I backtraced it \u2026 you\u2019ve been reported to the cyberpolice \u2026 And if you come near my daughter, guess what? Consequences will never be the same.\u201d His malapropisms and bumbling misunderstanding of the internet only fanned the flames of the exact trolls he was trying to ward off.","Jessi, at 17, now identifies as Damien and prefers they\/them pronouns (the surname Slaughter was sort of a nom de emo). Damien talked with BuzzFeed\u2019s Internet Explorer podcast about how the video impacted their life and why the internet in 2010 was such a mean place."," youtube.com","","Leonhardt\u2019s over-the-top rant ensured that the video blew through the tiny corner of the internet that birthed it and found a much more mainstream audience, one that was just happy to chuckle at a funny video during the office lunch break. The video was picked up by a number of blogs and websites (including a nascent BuzzFeed), and eventually the family even made an appearance on Good Morning America."," youtube.com","","However, the series of events that led up to the video was more disturbing than most people who got a mild laugh out of \u201cyou dun goofed\u201d realized. Damien, as \u201cJessi Slaughter\u201d (their real last name was Leonhardt), was a big emo music fan and was active on Myspace, along with fellow \u201cscene kids.\u201d Damien was very aware it was the last gasp of the platform\u2019s days.","They also were active on Stickam, a streaming video platform popular with teens and younger people, especially scene kids (somewhat similar in concept to today\u2019s YouNow live-streaming platform). A site called StickyDrama acted as a sort of gossip page to discuss various popular live-streamers. Someone on that site wrote a post claiming that some scene kid who went by Jessi Slaughter had hooked up with the singer of a popular emo band, Blood on the Dance Floor. It was written in a way that scolded and condemned the 11-year-old for promiscuity. Damien denied this on their Myspace page.","The singer, whose stage name is Dahvie Vanity, was about 25 at the time, and Damien was a child. This wasn\u2019t a rumor about a groupie and a rock star; it was a suggestion of child sexual assault. When BuzzFeed spoke with Damien, they told us they could not discuss this topic (persistent rumors spread online that Vanity had sexual contact with other very young fans). In any case, it was at the very least spurious internet gossip meant to slut-shame a young girl.","The allegation, along with other brash and profanity-laced videos Damien had on their YouTube account, attracted the attention of 4chan. (Damien believes it was someone from school who initially posted the video to 4chan.) It was this harassment \u2014 of a possible victim of a heinous crime \u2014 that caused Damien\u2019s father to scream into the camera, trying to protect his young daughter.","","","The video came out over summer vacation, so the impact on Damien\u2019s school life wasn\u2019t immediate. However, when they came back that fall, things had changed. \u201cI kind of lost all my friends and had to make new friends,\u201d Damien says. \u201cI had a clique of friends \u2014 the emo kids \u2014 in sixth grade, and none of them wanted anything to do with me after.\u201d","Life was not kind to Damien in following years. Not long after the video, they were placed into foster care. \u201cMy dad was really abusive toward me and my mom,\u201d says Damien. \u201cYou kind of saw the anger issues with him [in the video], and that put extra stress on the family, which made him even angrier.\u201d In 2011, their father died of a heart attack, and in 2012, Damien moved back in with their mother in a small town in Florida.","The harassment never stopped. \u201cAt first it was just comments on YouTube and stuff like that,\u201d says Damien. \u201cAnd that was like, well, it\u2019s public and people are dicks. But when people are actively seeking your stuff out to send you hateful messages and harass you, that\u2019s scarier to me.\u201d","Six years later, Damien has some perspective on what happened. They have an active Tumblr, where despite some trolling, there\u2019s a positive community. They get messages to their Tumblr from people asking for advice and help dealing with harassment. \u201cI want to use my experiences to help other people, and also to help myself grow as a person and to get more involved with things that can help other people.\u201d","The internet is a very different place now that it was in 2010. Even though the internet wasn\u2019t new or frightening then, it wasn\u2019t like today, where everyone\u2019s aunt is on Facebook and has a smartphone and understands the basic concepts of social media. And somehow, in the years in between, the internet has become something of a nicer place in many ways (although of course harassment still exists).","The way we understand patterns of harassment has completely changed. Cyberbullying isn\u2019t just something you hear about on the news relating to teenagers \u2014 online harassment is a very real issue, even to many adults. No one knows this better than Damien. \u201cNowadays, people are a lot more understanding that, yes, there\u2019s a person behind that photo, there\u2019s a person behind that video,\u201d they say. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a funny picture that has no meaning when you share things. It has a meaning to the person who put it there. We\u2019re connected; it\u2019s not just a cold screen. But even now, I feel like people still sort of don\u2019t understand completely that what they do has an impact. Even if you\u2019re not meaning it to be harassing or harmful, it still has an impact.\u201d","View this embed \u203a","Subscribe to the Internet Explorer podcast on iTunes.
